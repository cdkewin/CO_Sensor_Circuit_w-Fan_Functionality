# CO_Sensor_Circuit_w-Fan_Functionality
The project required a system design using a resistive gas sensor for the purpose of maintaining the concentration of carbon monoxide in an enclosure between the indoor carbon monoxide concentration of 300 ppm to 15000 ppm. When the concentration of carbon monoxide reaches the lower limit of 300 ppm, the designed system should stop the fan, letting carbon monoxide build back up. The sensor's measurement range is between 50 ppm and 17000 ppm. Between these limits, the sensor's resistance varies between 20kΩ and 75kΩ. This variation of the sensor's resistance must be converted in voltage variation between 2V and 12V, as the only voltage source allowed to be used is a Vcc = 14V. The fan must be controlled by a hysteresis comparator via a relay modulated with a resistor. The state of the fan must be displayed using a red LED.
